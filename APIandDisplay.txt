We define the apiUrl variable to store the URL of the API we want to fetch data from (in this case, the JSONPlaceholder API's posts endpoint).

We use the fetch function to make a GET request to the specified API URL.

In the first .then block, we check the response status to ensure it's a successful response (status code 200). If the response is OK, we parse the JSON data using response.json().

In the second .then block, we log the retrieved data to the console.

If there is an error at any point during the fetch process, it will be caught in the .catch block, and the error message will be logged to the console.
