Algo:
The fetchDataFromTwoAPIs function defines the URLs for both API endpoints.

Inside the try block, Promise.all is used to fetch data from both APIs concurrently. This is more efficient than making sequential requests.

We check if the response of each API is OK. If any of the responses is not OK, we throw an error.

We use await to parse the JSON data from both responses.

The combined data is created as an object with keys "todo" and "post," and the corresponding values are the results from the respective APIs.

Finally, the combined data is logged to the console.
