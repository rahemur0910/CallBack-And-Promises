ALGO:
The logBookTitles function accepts an array of book objects and a callback function as parameters.

Inside the function, it uses the map method to extract only the titles of the books and store them in the bookTitles array.

It sorts the bookTitles array in alphabetical order using the sort method.

Finally, it calls the provided callback function and passes the sorted list of titles to it for logging.
